Deployment Options
----------------

RevSin can be deployed in several ways, depending on your requirements:

1. **Docker Deployment**: Using Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment
2. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Scaling with Kubernetes for larger installations
3. **Serverless Deployment**: Using serverless platforms for API endpoints
4. **Traditional Deployment**: Using traditional web servers like Nginx and Gunicorn

Production Requirements
---------------------

Before deploying RevSin in production, ensure you have:

* A PostgreSQL database (or NeonDB account)
* A Redis instance (or Upstash Redis account)
* Proper environment configuration
* SSL certificates for HTTPS
* Monitoring and logging setup

Environment Configuration
----------------------

RevSin uses environment variables for configuration. In production, you should:

1. Set up secure environment variables
2. Use a proper secrets management solution
3. Configure the following key variables:

.. code-block:: text

   # Database
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/dbname
   
   # Redis
   REDIS_URL=redis://user:password@host:port
   
   # Security
   SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
   ALGORITHM=HS256
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
   
   # Server
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   PORT=8000
   WORKERS=4
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   
   # Features
   ENABLE_CACHE=true
   ENABLE_METRICS=true

Production Server
---------------

For production deployment, use Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers:

.. code-block:: bash

   gunicorn revsin.main:app -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

Or use the provided production server script:

.. code-block:: bash

   python run_production.py

Scaling Considerations
-------------------

When scaling RevSin for larger deployments:

1. **Database**: Consider read replicas and connection pooling
2. **Redis**: Use Redis Cluster for high availability
3. **API Servers**: Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
4. **Caching**: Implement proper caching strategies
5. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits

Security Checklist
---------------

Before going live, ensure you've addressed these security considerations:

* HTTPS is properly configured
* Database credentials are secure
* JWT secret key is strong and secure
* Rate limiting is implemented
* Input validation is thorough
* Proper error handling is in place
* Logging doesn't expose sensitive information
